# LL Parser for programming language ΓΛΩΣΣΑ (GLOSSA)

ΓΛΩΣΣΑ (GLOSSA) is a programming language that is taught in the 3rd grade of senior high school. For now it recognizes the basic constructs of the language but needs more to be complete.

Η ΓΛΩΣΣΑ είναι μια γλώσσα προγραμματισμού που διδάσκεται στα πλαίσια του μαθήματος Ανάπτυξη εφαρμογών σε προγραμματιστικό περιβάλλον (ΑΕΠΠ) της Γ΄ Γενικού Λυκείου.

There is already a full-featured GUI application that implements the interpreter. It is used mainly for educational purposes and contains many features such as:
- Breakpoints
- Auto-complete features
- Syntax highlighting
- many more...

You can find [here](http://alkisg.mysch.gr/) the application. It is actively developed since 2001. Of course, the code is open-source.
